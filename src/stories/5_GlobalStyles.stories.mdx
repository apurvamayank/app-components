# Global Styles

When adding svg assets to your app, replace the hard coded colors in them with classes that are automatically created by the AppTheme, to make them brandable. 
For instance, if an svg uses the theme a-350 color of "#40B2FE", replace: 

````svg
<polygon fill="#40B2FE"></polygon>
````
with: 
````svg
<polygon class="a-350-fill"></polygon>
````

Now, if the first hue color is changed in the branding process, the theme palette will be regenerated, and the svg's polygon fill color will change accordingly.

There are similar classes created for all color stops for accent (first hue), secondary (second hue), primary (neutral), and custom colors. 
For first (a prefix), secondary (s prefix), and custom colors (e.g. custom-c1, custom-c2... based on the c1, c2... prefixes provided in the AppTheme) the color stops generated in the palette are: 100, 200, 300, 350, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800.
For neutral (p prefix) the color stops are: 0 (white), 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 (see examples in the [colors page](/story/colors--page?path=/story/colors--page)).

The structure of each generated class is: 

"a"/"s"/"p"/custom color prefix + "-" + color stop + "-" + attribute.

Where the attributes are "fill", "stroke", and "stop-color".
